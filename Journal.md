Today I have started my first Component for the assignment, which is to have a First Person script be able to pickup and drop items, which then the 3 other components will be able to work with the player script.

However I had to rewind back when making my camera movement as I had done the work in the wrong scene so had to make a whole new scene and put it inside the right folder, which meant redoing the scene. The positive outcome is I had all the code already done so it was just redoing the visuals and assigning the code.

As i was adding a new script to my scene, it seemed to duplicate a script in my folder causing issues when trying to run, so i had to go into my files and delete the script and delete the component of the script and add in my new script.

When i added in my code for the holding of a object, i mispelled a line of code making the script not work. I didnt notice this until i was showing my tutor which i noticed not long after. Once that was fixed the script was fine and able to work.

Today i will be adding a health bar mechanic so that next week when adding a enemy attack my character has a health depletion mechanic
After i finished coding the health bar next for an example i needed to give the bar to a player script which allows me to push space which will decrease the players health, however no Errors were showing but it would not let me run the the game so i went back a few steps and followed where i went wrong.
i decided to rewrite the whole player code which didnt take to long, as i feel like i had wrote or mispelled some of the script but once i did that it wokred.

In todays Lesson i went onto my 3rd component which is the Enemy AI which will follow a path until disturbed which it will attack a player. I have the script working but will need to test this in a scene with a player component and see if work with the first two other components.
