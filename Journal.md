Today I have started my first Component for the assignment, which is to have a First Person script be able to pickup and drop items, which then the 3 other components will be able to work with the player script.

However I had to rewind back when making my camera movement as I had done the work in the wrong scene so had to make a whole new scene and put it inside the right folder, which meant redoing the scene. The positive outcome is I had all the code already done so it was just redoing the visuals and assigning the code.

As i was adding a new script to my scene, it seemed to duplicate a script in my folder causing issues when trying to run, so i had to go into my files and delete the script and delete the component of the script and add in my new script.

When i added in my code for the holding of a object, i mispelled a line of code making the script not work. I didnt notice this until i was showing my tutor which i noticed not long after. Once that was fixed the script was fine and able to work.
